I am interested in data science because I love to gain insights from data, data science is the future, i want to be part of the future.

The following code sets a numeric variable to 13, then adds 0 to the variable. The value is printed in a sentence.

a= 13
a= a + 0
print("The value of a is", a)

The value of a is 1
